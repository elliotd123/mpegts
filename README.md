# mpegts
Python module for decoding MPEG2 transport streams

Updated explicitly for obtaining multicast UDP streams, and some other hacks for testing

I'm not sure exactly where I'm going with this yet, but I would like to be able to collect data from a live multicast stream and export to a database or something
